# Object-Detection-Using--YOLOV8
Project Description: Object Detection Using YOLOv8
The Object Detection Using YOLOv8 project focuses on implementing the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) model for real-time object detection in images and videos. This project aims to accurately identify and classify multiple objects within a single frame, making it suitable for various applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and robotics.

Methodology:
The project leverages the YOLOv8 architecture, which employs a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images. The dataset used for training consists of labeled images containing various objects. The model is trained to learn the spatial relationships and features of the objects in the images.

Results:
After training, the model can detect and classify objects in real time, drawing bounding boxes around detected objects with corresponding class labels. The results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately identifying objects across diverse environments, showcasing the capabilities of advanced deep learning techniques in computer vision tasks.
